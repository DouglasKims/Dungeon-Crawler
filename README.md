# Dungeon-Crawler

A simple, console-based Dungeon Crawler game made using Python. It's heavily based on the Etrian Odyssey series for the Nintendo DS.

This is a working demo, with some features missing, but the basics of exploration and combat are all in place.

Currently, you can:
* Create and manage a custom party, featuring several races and six unique classes (Knight, Scout, Arcanist, Thaumaturge, Herald, and Quartermaster)
* Shop for items and use them in combat or while exploring the Dungeon.
* Explore a 30x30 squares dungeon, complete with a day and night cycle.
